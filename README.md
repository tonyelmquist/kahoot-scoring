## NUMBER FIELD DEMO

A very simple React application that lets you add items to your gameplay and scores it according to a preset schema of bonuses.

## NOTES:

I chose to use an off-the-shelf animated button to make it pretty; I started abstracting out dumb components and adding some test coverage; if this was a real app I would continue with that.

## SETUP

To run the app, first run

    npm install  

and then start the app by running

    npm run start

this will start a webpack dev server to serve up the local files, and should open your browser to http://localhost:8080 to view the miniapp.

That's it!
